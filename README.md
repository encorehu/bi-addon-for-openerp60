bi-addon-for-openerp60
======================

OpenER Web Client for the BI on openerp 5.x, now I integrated it as a web addon for openerp v6.0, working in progress.

How to use?
===========

[2013-06-13]
put directory `tinybi` under the addons folder of your openerp v6.0 web folder, such as 
C:\Program Files\OpenERP 6.0\Web\addons  or your other testing source code project's web-client addons folder, such as D:\Projects\openerp-web-6.0.4\addons
